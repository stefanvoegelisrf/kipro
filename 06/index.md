## Postcard excercise

We are slowly approaching the middle of the semester and it is a good moment to look back at what we have already done. With translate(), rotate() and scale() we have learned important new functions with which we can quickly create patterns and generative shapes. Have a look at the wiki pages in the exorciser of the last weeks. Especially have a look at the loops with for/while.

The idea with the generative postcard is that you capture the output of one of your sketches in postcard format. It's not primarily about creating a highly complex mathematical pattern, but about showing off your design skills. Take notes on paper and ask yourself what aesthetics you want to use. What do you want to express? Does the format or history of the postcard matter? Time, transportation? Is there an overriding theme to your design? A word that fits? Is it a series?

By choosing the cut-out, color and possibly typography, you determine important design parameters.
